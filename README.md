A Wireless, Solar Powered GPS &amp; Compass Dongle using Bluetooth Low Energy

This is the source code, intended to run on a Nordic Semiconductor nRF51822 processor, for a GPS and compass device reporting
its heading and position using the Bluetooth Low Energy service "Location and Navigation".

See the Hackaday project [Wireless Navigation Sensor](https://hackaday.io/project/10415-wireless-navigation-sensor).

Don't hesitate to ask me if you have problems building this code.
